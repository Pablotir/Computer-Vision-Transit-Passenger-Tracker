# Computer-Vision-Transit-Passenger-Tracker
Keeps track of the amount of passengers on board, the time it takes to board, and tracks when to close the doors after boarding is done

This is done with a camera mounted above an entrance/exit at roughly 45 to an 80 degree angle (whichever is better suited for you)

V 1.0: Uses a base free face tracking model found online

V 2.0: Pending- using a custom built model to better track the top of people's heads when angled at 90 degrees
